# castanedaPMadlibEndpoint
Created Controller and Endpoint that calls a function when user enters 12 word types then outputs the Madlib story with their words included.

Peer Review by Madeline Gowan; The code runs as it should based on what we've learned so far. I also like the addition of data validation, how it says "invalid" if you enter a number.
